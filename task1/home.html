                intimidating. There are workouts to learn, diets to follow, willpower to conjure, and self-consciousness

                But making the decision to start a fitness regimen and making strides toward improving your health are
                the absolute best things you can do for yourself-mind and body. So give yourself a big pat on the back,
                then listen to the sage advice of trainer, coach, natural bodybuilder, and gym owner Eric Broser.

                While there are bodyweight exercises you can do in a gym (pull-ups, anyone?), having a calisthenics or
                plyometrics routine means you can stay in shape without the need for a gym membership or expensive
                equipment.

            <p><span class="bold">What type of training should I do to lose weight? </span> <br><br><br>
                When it comes to losing weight, you need a combination of weight/resistance training and cardiovascular
                exercise. Many people make the error of performing too much cardio and neglecting weightlifting,
                thinking that only treadmills, stationary bikes, and stair steppers are responsible for burning fat —but
                this is far from true. <br><br>
                While cardio will certainly help you burn extra calories, it's weight training that is going to
                stimulate the metabolism (so that you become a fat-burning machine), change the composition of your
                body, and bring about the shape and contours you want. I suggest at least three to four days per week
                lifting weights and four to five performing cardio — preferably first thing in the morning or right
                after resistance training.<br><br>
                Starting a fitness journey can be intimidating. There are workouts to learn, diets to follow, willpower
                to conjure, and self-consciousness to overcome. But making the decision to start a fitness regimen and
                making strides toward improving your health are the absolute best things you can do for yourself — mind
                and body. So give yourself a big pat on the back, then listen to the sage advice of trainer, coach,
