                    Have some healthy carbs at least an hour in advance of your workout. Try a bowl of whole-grain
                    cereal with skim milk and cut up fruit or some whole wheat toast or a bagel. Cream cheese and butter
                    add saturated fat.

                    bottle of juice. A lot of the fiber in whole fruits is lost as they become juice. Blueberries, in
                    particular, have been shown to reduce muscle soreness from strenuous exercise. Cherries are another
                    good option. But any berry will likely help.
